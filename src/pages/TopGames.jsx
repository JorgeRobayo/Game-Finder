              Is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios
              and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows
              and Macintosh in 2001, it is the second game in the Age of Empires
              series. The Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages and contains
              thirteen playable civilizations. Players aim to gather resources,
              which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their
              enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which
              conscript the player to specialized and story-backed conditions,
              as well as three additional single-player game modes; multiplayer
              is also supported.

            Reception of Age of Empires II was highly positive. The significant
            number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay
            improvements. The game received "universal acclaim" according to
            video game review aggregator Metacritic. Three months after its
            release, two million copies of Age of Empires II had been shipped,
            and it topped sales charts in seven countries. The game won multiple
            awards and is today considered a classic of its type, having had a
            significant impact on future games in its genre. The original Age of
            Empires II and its 2000 expansion pack, The Conquerors, were later
            released as The Gold Edition. Age of Empires II is often considered
            one of the greatest games ever made.

              The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as "a
              grand culmination" of the Famicom team's three years of game
              mechanics and programming, drawing from their experiences working
              on Devil World and the side-scrollers Excitebike and Kung Fu to
              advance their previous work on platforming "athletic games" such
              as Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. The design of the first level,
              World 1-1, serves as a tutorial for platform gameplay.

            A game that makes you feel good about punching a journalist while
            also making you feel bad for fancying a polygonal alien, Mass Effect
            was BioWare's big new punt at a not-Star Wars space opera IP about
            evil squids destroying the universe. It was great - but the series'
            best moments were yet to come.

              Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by
              Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh
              main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand
              Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within
              the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California,
              the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank
              robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and
              drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts to
              commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government
              agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players
              freely roam San Andreas's open countryside and the fictional city
              of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.

            <h3>
              Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either
              a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete
              missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through
              the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the
              open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area,
              including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city of
              Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries
              in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's beginning
              without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay
              content.
